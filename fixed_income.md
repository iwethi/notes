### Fixed Income Market Summaries  

#### Equity vs Fixed-Income Markets  
Equity dominated by Stocks - Fixed Income dominated by Government/Corporate Bonds  
Equity - Higher returns, Higher risk, Higher accessibility, Higher aggression (from traders/investors)  
Asset Management strategies generally more varied & numerous in equities due to higher risk/reward  
#### Fixed Income/Debt Securities Markets  
Debt security - debt instrument coming with defined terms - notational amount (amt. borrowed), interest rate, maturity/renewal date  
Most Debt Securities typically traded otc rather than being market made - auctions like US treasury bill auctions (held every week and set the yield rate through bidding through an electronic dutch auction)  
ETF's can have exposure to bonds and provide smaller investors with access to debt securities products, where usually smaller investors are unable to access the fixed income market  
Asset Managers look for products with "investment grade" credit rating in order to ensure low risk of default on the debt instrument - ratings agencies such as S&P, Moody's will categorise using different designations- either "investment grade" or "junk bonds"  
"Fallen Angels" are investment grade bonds re-rated as junk bonds - forces selling from funds restricted only to investment-grade bonds  
High-yield bonds = higher yield but higher risk of default - e.g. from startups  
zero-coupon bond - a bond that pays out no interest (coupon payments=interest) and the buyer receives only the face value of the bond upon maturity  
Laddering: fund manager buys many short-term bonds with staggered maturity dates in order to have access to ready capital and not miss out on rising interest rates  
#### Different types of fixed income products:  
T-bills - short term fixed income securities - one year maturity, do not pay coupon returns  
T-notes - maturities between 2-10 years, pay a fixed interest rate  
T-bonds - similar to the t-note except it matures in 20 or 30 years  
TIPS Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities - protects investors from inflation - principal amount of a TIPS bond adjusts with inflation and deflation.  
Municipal Bonds - issued by city/state gov, Corporate bonds issued by companies  
junk bonds - high yield bonds pay a greater coupon due to higher risk of default  
Interest rate risk - risk of interest rates rising on their specific product (e.g. 2 year t-notes) leaving their bond devalued on the secondary market. Also exposed to "inflationary risk", risk of inflation rising and their bond earning less in real terms  
##### zero coupon bonds vs coupon bonds  
zc-bonds more volatile - offer speculators more profit from anticipated price movements  
often cheaper to similar coupon bonds due to lack of interest payments - higher yield  
zc corporate bonds used for speculating on the health of the underlying company  
#### Calculating bond pricing:  
YTM - yield to maturity = discount rate that can be used to make the present value of all future cash flows equal to price.  
price - sum of present value of all future cashflows - present value calculated with the same discount factor - the discount factor is the yield, yield rises when price falls and vice versa  
yield of a bond largely affected by time to maturity of a bond - longer term = greater discount = higher yield  
yield curve = yield graph of similar credit classes of bonds (eg gov bonds) with different maturity rates  
"inflation is a bond's worst enemy" - the higher the current rate of inflation - the higher the yields will rise across the yield curve - investors demand higher yields to offset inflation  
short/long term interest rates and inflation expectations  
Federal Reserve sets the federal funds rate at the FOMC (federal open market committee) - highly correlated with other short-term interest rates  
central banks do not control long-term interest rates- - market forces determine pricing for long term bonds - if the bond market believes that the funds rate is too low, expectations of future inflation increase and the yield curve steepens, if the bond market believes the funds rate is too high, the yield curve flattens.  
interest rates, bond yields (prices) and inflation expectations correlate with one another - when the central bank dictates the interest rates, the market will then determine long-term bond yields through the market belief on inflation (and whether or not enough is being done to combat it)  
YTM calculations are made by determining the interest (discount) rate that will make the sum of a bond's cash flows equal to the current price. each future interest payment/cash flow must be discounted with the appropriate spot rate in order to calculate the price.  
different bond classifications use different pricing benchmarks e.g. treasury curve, eurodollar curve  
yield spread: yield of a bond relative to its benchmark (e.g. a corporate 10 year bond trading at x bps spread to us 10y treasuries)  
#### yield curve:  
yield curve is a graph that plots the yields/interest rates of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates (e.g. 1y 5y 10y treasuries)  
yield curve shapes: normal (upward sloping) inverted (downwards sloping) and flat  
normal: economic expansion, inverted: economic recession  
steeper (normal) yield curve implies higher rate of economic growth (...or more inflation?)  
inverted yield curve: economic downturn, investors so unwilling to bid equities that they bid long-term bonds and drive down yields (expectation that yields become even lower in the future)  
flat curve: similar yields for all maturities - may come at the end of a high economic growth period as market fears a slowdown - central bank maybe expected to raise rates  
yield curve risk: risk fixed-income investors may experience from an adverse shift in interest rates. bond prices/interest rates have an inverse relationship, so investors may suffer if their predictions on future inflation turn out to be incorrect.
